🪐 About the Project

The Stellar Haven project was created for the 2025 NASA Space Apps Challenge (Advanced Level) — an international hackathon uniting innovators, developers, and scientists to solve challenges inspired by NASA’s open data.

Our goal: use Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) to identify exoplanets automatically from large NASA datasets such as Kepler, TESS, and the Exoplanet Archive.

By training a deep learning model on NASA’s open-source data, we aimed to automate the process of exoplanet discovery — accelerating how scientists analyze and classify planets outside our solar system. 🌠

Objectives

Develop an AI/ML model trained on NASA’s exoplanet datasets
