# Spaceapps2025-celestialcoders-solution
An AI-powered solution developed for NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025 by Team Celestial Coders — addressing [A World Away: Hunting for Exoplanets with AI]


🪐 About the Project

The Stellar Haven project was created for the 2025 NASA Space Apps Challenge (Advanced Level) — an international hackathon uniting innovators, developers, and scientists to solve challenges inspired by NASA’s open data.

Our goal: use Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) to identify exoplanets automatically from large NASA datasets such as Kepler, TESS, and the Exoplanet Archive.

By training a deep learning model on NASA’s open-source data, we aimed to automate the process of exoplanet discovery — accelerating how scientists analyze and classify planets outside our solar system. 🌠

Challenge Theme

AI/ML for Exoplanet Discovery
Thousands of exoplanets have been discovered manually from mission data — our challenge was to build an automated system that learns from NASA’s datasets and accurately identifies new exoplanet candidates.

Objectives

Develop an AI/ML model trained on NASA’s exoplanet datasets

Automate detection of exoplanet candidates from new data

Enable data visualization and interactive exploration of results

Improve data accuracy and reduce false positives in classification

Key Features

🔭 Deep Learning Models (Random Forest) for classification

🧠 AI-Powered Predictions from light curve and mission data

📊 Data Visualization Dashboard for exoplanet analysis

🌌 Dataset Integration (Kepler, TESS, NASA Archive)

⚙️ Modular Codebase for easy scalability and future datasets
